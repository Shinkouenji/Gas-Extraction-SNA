# Gas-Extraction-SNA
This repository contains the notebooks that were created for the master thesis project by s5724090.
This project used Dutch Twitter data with the hashtag gas extraction (#gaswinning) to create a social network analysis.

The notebook called Tagging_no_visible_data shows how the data was preprocessed and contains the code that was used to tag nodes as either P (Political), M (Media), AG (Action Group), or OC (Ordinary Citizen).  
The notebook called Gephi_preparation_no_visible_data contains the code that was used to format the original data to edgelist CSV files and nodelist CSV files.

Both notebooks have been modified to show no personal data, only aggregated data is visible.
